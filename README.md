# Github Feed Viewer
Created for the 2015 CompE Hackathon @ Startup Edmonton, displays a live updating feed of commits from repos specified in js file. Don't forget to add you Github auth token in the js file to make the requests as I didn't feel like sharing mine ;)

Ideal for runnning on a projector so everyone can see how bad of a coder you are
